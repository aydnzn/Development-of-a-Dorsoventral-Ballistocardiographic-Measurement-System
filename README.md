# Internship Project: Development of a Dorsoventral Ballistocardiographic Measurement System

### Project Description
This project focuses on the development of a dorsoventral ballistocardiographic measurement system, specifically targeted at detecting ballistocardiographic impedance distortions in capacitive ECG. 

### Overview
This repository serves as the comprehensive archive of all the deliverables, artifacts, and insights gathered during my tenure as an intern at the [Medical Information Technology (MedIT), Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University](https://www.medit.hia.rwth-aachen.de). The focus of my work centered around the design and development of capacitive ECG (cECG) and Ballistocardiography (BCG) systems, particularly exploring the nuances of human body's physiological vibrations and its impact on coupling impedance in cECG.

### Contributors
This project was gracefully guided by [Mr. Uguz](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086875617). I had the opportunity to develop the BCG measurement system, while my colleague, [Tuna](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089188379), worked on the development of the impedance measurement system.

Our collaborative work, including my contributions, have been recognized and included in this [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8979354) authored by Mr. Uguz.
